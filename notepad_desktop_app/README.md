## Future Improvements

### Core Concept

A digital RPG notebook: feels like a regular notepad, but has built-in tools that match the needs of tabletop RPG players. The focus is on being simple, fast, and immersive, not bloated like a wiki or VTT (Virtual Tabletop).

### Features Ideas

#### 1. Player Notes
- Quick notes during sessions (shortcuts for "Session Notes," "NPCs," "Items")
- Ability to tag notes (e.g., "Quest," "Character," "Location")
- Session log timeline (auto-organizes notes by date)

#### 2. Character Sheets Integration
- Editable, customizable character sheet pages (stats, spells, inventory)
- Auto-link to notes (e.g., clicking on "magic sword" shows session notes where it appeared)
- Level-up tracker with notes about milestones

#### 3. Campaign Notebook
- Separate notebooks for each campaign
- Shared session recap page (great for GMs and players)
- Cross-reference system: highlight a word ("Goblin King") and see all notes where it's mentioned

#### 4. Immersion
- Notebook skins/themes (fantasy parchment, arcane grimoire, steampunk journal)
- Dice roller embedded in the notepad
- Option to insert drawings, maps, symbols like doodling in the margins

#### 5. Quality-of-life
- Offline-first app (no need for internet during a session)
- Export notes as PDF/Markdown for sharing
- Optional cloud sync for groups
- Searchable index (find NPC names quickly)
